1. Introduction to Splunk
==============================

What is Splunk?
---------------
Splunk is a powerful platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated big data via a web-style interface.
It stores, indexes, and correlates real-time data in a searchable repository from which it can generate graphs, reports,
alerts, dashboards, and visualizations.

Why Use Splunk?
---------------
- Centralized log analysis
- Real-time monitoring
- Powerful dashboards
- Alerting and automation
- Extensible via apps and add-ons

Splunk Components:
------------------
1. **Universal Forwarder (UF)** – Lightweight agent that sends logs to Splunk Indexer.
2. **Indexer** – Parses and indexes the incoming data.
3. **Search Head (SH)** – Frontend used to run searches and build visualizations.
4. **Deployment Server** – Manages configurations for multiple Splunk instances.

Data Flow in Splunk:
--------------------
1. Log sources → UF → Indexer → SH
2. Raw data → Parsing → Indexing → Searching → Reporting

Indexes:
--------
- Logical data storage locations (like folders)
- Default index: `main`
- Custom indexes can be created

Example Log (from secure.log):
------------------------------
`Jun 08 18:20:24 sshd[4747]: Failed password for invalid user john from 10.0.0.4 port 22`

Basic Search:
-------------
splunk
index=linux_logs sourcetype=secure.log "Failed password"

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Understand each Splunk component and its role.
📌 Know the data flow and difference between UF, Indexer, and SH.
📌 Remember where parsing, indexing, and searching occur.

==============================
2. Navigating the Splunk Interface
==============================

Overview:
---------
Splunk's Web Interface (Search Head) is where analysts perform searches, build dashboards, create alerts, and view visualizations.

Main UI Components:
-------------------
1. Search Bar – Where SPL queries are written.
2. Time Range Picker – Choose time windows like "Last 24 hours" or custom time.
3. Sidebar Panel – Displays Datasets, Reports, Alerts, Apps, and Settings.
4. Fields Panel – Shows all indexed and extracted fields for each event.
5. Events Viewer – Displays event logs with field highlighting.

Time Range Picker:
------------------
This is critical to scope your searches correctly.

Search Modes:
-------------
1. Fast – Fastest, skips field discovery.
2. Smart – Default mode, balances speed and field discovery.
3. Verbose – Slower, discovers all fields.

Field Discovery:
----------------
Selected Fields: _time, host, source, sourcetype
Interesting Fields: Splunk's suggested fields

Example:
--------
splunk
index=linux_logs sourcetype=secure.log "Failed password"
| stats count by user

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Know what each UI panel is used for.
📌 Understand when to use Fast vs. Smart vs. Verbose search modes.
📌 The Time Picker greatly affects results — avoid forgetting to check it!

<summary>📘 3. Time Ranges in Splunk</summary>

```
==============================
3. Time Ranges in Splunk
==============================

Overview:
---------
Time range selection is one of the most critical aspects of Splunk searches.

Time Picker Presets:
--------------------
- Last 15 minutes
- Last 24 hours
- Last 7 days
- Yesterday
- Real-time

Relative Time:
--------------
- `-1h@h` = 1 hour ago aligned to hour
- `-15m@m` = 15 minutes ago, aligned to minute

Time Modifiers in SPL:
----------------------
splunk
index=syslog earliest=-2h
index=syslog earliest="07/27/2025:08:00:00" latest="07/27/2025:10:00:00"


Real-Time Searches:
-------------------
- Live dashboarding
- Use with care (high system usage)

Example Query:
--------------
splunk
index=linux_logs sourcetype=secure.log "Failed password"
| stats count by src_ip
| where count > 10
earliest=-1h


Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Set the right time range before running queries.
📌 Know real-time vs. historical tradeoffs.
📌 Understand time modifiers (`earliest`, `latest`).
```

<summary>📘 4. SPL Syntax and Search Pipeline</summary>

```
==============================
4. SPL Syntax and Search Pipeline
==============================

Overview:
---------
SPL (Search Processing Language) is how you query data in Splunk.

Structure:
----------
Each command is separated by a pipe (`|`) symbol.

Example:
--------
splunk
index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| stats count by status


Command Types:
--------------
- Search: `index=main`
- Transforming: `stats`, `chart`, `timechart`
- Filtering: `where`, `fields`, `dedup`
- Eval: `eval`, `if`, `case`
- Format: `table`, `sort`

Example Query:
--------------
splunk
index=web sourcetype=access_combined
| eval is_error=if(status>=400, "yes", "no")
| stats count by is_error


Real-World Example:
-------------------
splunk
index=linux_logs sourcetype=secure.log "Failed password"
| eval day=strftime(_time, "%A")
| stats count by day, user

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 SPL syntax is case-sensitive.
📌 Don’t forget the `|` between commands.
📌 Understand the role of each command type in the pipeline.

<summary> 📘 5. Using Fields and Field Extraction</summary>

```
==============================
5. Using Fields and Field Extraction
==============================

Overview:
---------
Fields are key-value pairs extracted from event data. Splunk automatically extracts some fields and allows manual extractions.

Types of Fields:
----------------
- Default Fields: _time, host, source, sourcetype
- Indexed Fields: Extracted at index time (e.g., host)
- Search-time Fields: Extracted when a search is run (e.g., status)

Field Panels:
-------------
- Selected Fields: Always shown in UI
- Interesting Fields: Frequently occurring in current results

Field Extraction Methods:
-------------------------
1. Interactive Extraction – via UI (Settings > Fields > Field Extractions)
2. Using `rex` – Regular expression based extraction
3. Using `spath` – Extract fields from JSON logs

Example using `rex`:
---------------------
index=linux_logs sourcetype=secure.log
| rex "Failed password for (?<user>\w+) from (?<ip>\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)"

Example using `spath` (for JSON):
---------------------------------
index=api sourcetype=json_logs
| spath input=payload path=user.id output=user_id

Best Practices:
---------------
- Use `rex` for unstructured logs
- Use `spath` for JSON or XML
- Avoid extracting the same field multiple times

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Understand difference between indexed vs search-time fields.
📌 Practice both `rex` and `spath` syntax.
📌 Know where to configure field extractions in the UI.
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>📘 6. Using Search Modes</summary>

```
==============================
6. Using Search Modes
==============================

Overview:
---------
Search Modes determine how much field discovery Splunk performs, which affects speed and detail.

Modes:
------
1. Fast – Minimal field extraction; fastest.
2. Smart – Balanced; default mode.
3. Verbose – Maximum field extraction; slowest.

When to Use:
------------
- Fast: For saved reports, known fields
- Smart: General searching
- Verbose: Exploratory searching

Comparison Table:
-----------------
Mode     | Field Discovery | Speed
---------|------------------|-------
Fast     | Minimal          | 🔥 Fast
Smart    | Conditional      | ⚖️ Balanced
Verbose  | Full             | 🐢 Slow

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Know when to switch modes.
📌 Verbose is needed for field discovery.
📌 Smart adjusts based on pipeline usage.

```
==============================
15. Combined Exam Tips (All Sections)
==============================

This section consolidates the most important exam tips scattered across all prior sections and lecture screenshots.

General Exam Tips:
------------------
✅ Understand the architecture – role of Indexer, Search Head, Universal Forwarder  
✅ Know the difference between real-time, scheduled, and historical searches  
✅ Use Time Picker wisely – avoid querying too much data  
✅ SPL is case-sensitive – especially field names  
✅ Syntax errors often stem from missing `|` or incorrect field references  
✅ Save time by knowing when to use Fast, Smart, or Verbose search modes  
✅ Pay attention to default vs. interesting fields in the Fields panel  
✅ Practice regex (`rex`) and JSON field extraction (`spath`)  
✅ Use `eval` to create dynamic fields and `stats` for summary views  
✅ `timechart` always needs `_time` field  
✅ Reports vs Dashboards: Reports are for static outputs, Dashboards are for interactive visualization  
✅ Alerts are scheduled searches with trigger conditions and actions  
✅ Lookup usage is critical – understand `inputlookup`, `lookup`, and `outputlookup`  
✅ Knowledge objects and their permissions (private, app, global) frequently appear in exams  

Pro Tips:
----------------------
✅ Pivot allows visualization without writing SPL – good for business users  
✅ Accelerated Datasets enhance dashboard speed – ideal for scheduled panels  
✅ Use calculated fields instead of rewriting SPL every time  
✅ Don’t mix index-time and search-time field logic in same query  
✅ Tags and event types are critical for data model mapping and CIM compliance  
✅ Real-time alerts are costly – prefer scheduled unless justified  
✅ Field aliasing is useful when dealing with multiple sourcetypes  
✅ Use summary indexing to reduce computation for frequent reports/alerts  
✅ Use dropdowns and dynamic filters in dashboards to enhance usability  
✅ Use `dc()` for distinct count and `values()` to list unique items

Suggested Strategy for Exam:
----------------------------
🧠 Memorize SPL syntax and functions: `stats`, `eval`, `dedup`, `chart`, `table`, `sort`, `rename`  
🧪 Practice queries using provided sample logs (e.g., `secure.log`)  
🧩 Use scenario-based logic: Know what search should be used to troubleshoot login issues or network errors  
📊 Practice building dashboards from raw searches  
🗂️ Understand the difference between fields, tags, event types, and calculated fields  

Recommended Practice:
---------------------
- Write at least 50 SPL queries using transforming + filtering commands  
- Create a dashboard with at least 3 panels: timechart, bar, and single-value  
- Configure a scheduled alert with condition >10 failed login attempts in 1h  
- Perform a lookup join with external CSV data  
- Use `rex` to extract usernames from secure.log manually
```

<summary>📘 16. Syntax Memorization & SPL Restrictions</summary>

```
==============================
16. Syntax Memorization & SPL Restrictions
==============================

This section provides a one-stop reference to memorize SPL (Search Processing Language) syntax and highlights key usage restrictions, caveats, and best practices.

-----------------------------
🔤 Case Sensitivity
-----------------------------
- SPL command names → **NOT** case-sensitive (e.g., `stats`, `STATS`, `Stats` all work)
- **Field names** → ✅ Case-sensitive (`status` ≠ `Status`)
- **String literals** in eval or where → ✅ Case-sensitive (`"error"` ≠ `"ERROR"`)

-----------------------------
📐 Command Placement & Pipes
-----------------------------
- Each SPL command is separated by a `|` (pipe)
- Commands must follow logical sequence:
  - Search first
  - Filtering / `eval`
  - Transforming / `stats`, `chart`
  - Formatting / `table`, `sort`

Wrong:
splunk
| table host | index=main


Correct:
splunk
index=main | table host


-----------------------------
📊 `stats` vs `chart` vs `timechart`
-----------------------------
- `stats` → General aggregation (no axis requirements)

splunk
index=web | stats count by status


- `chart` → Requires:
  - `OVER <field>` → x-axis
  - `BY <field>` → data series
splunk
index=web | chart avg(bytes) over status by host

- `timechart` → Requires `_time` field

splunk
index=web | timechart span=1h count by status


Restrictions:
-------------
- `chart` must use either `over` or `by`, not both together unless explicitly supported
- `timechart` **only supports 1 BY field** for splitting series

-----------------------------
🧠 Eval & Conditional Logic
-----------------------------
Eval creates or modifies fields dynamically.

Examples:
splunk
| eval error=if(status>=400, "yes", "no")
| eval user_type=case(role="admin", "privileged", role="guest", "limited")

Restrictions:
- Use `==` or `!=` for string equality, not `=`
- Always enclose string comparisons in `"double quotes"`

-----------------------------
🧹 Filtering Commands
-----------------------------
- `where` → Filters rows based on conditions
- `search` → Can be used inline for match
splunk
| where status=404
| search user=admin


Restrictions:
- `where` uses eval-style logic
- `search` uses keyword-based match

-----------------------------
🛑 Dedup, Sort, Rename, Table
-----------------------------
- `dedup <field>` → Remove duplicate values by field
- `sort` → Order rows (default 10000 limit)
splunk
| sort - _time


- `rename <old> AS <new>` → Rename fields
- `table <field1> <field2>` → Output clean column display

-----------------------------
🔍 Lookup Syntax
-----------------------------
splunk
| lookup ip_lookup ip AS client_ip OUTPUT location


Restrictions:
- Field names must match case exactly
- Lookup file must be defined in `Settings > Lookups`

-----------------------------
📚 Summary
-----------------------------

Command         | Purpose                        | Notes
----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------
`eval`          | Create fields                  | Case-sensitive values
`stats`         | Aggregate                      | Multiple fields OK
`chart`         | Visual summary                 | Use `over` / `by` with care
`timechart`     | Time-series graph              | Needs `_time`
`dedup`         | Remove dup rows                | 1 field only
`where`         | Conditional filter             | Uses eval syntax
`search`        | Keyword-based filter           | Simple text match
`table`         | Format as columns              | Final display
`sort`          | Sort rows                      | Default limit 10000
`lookup`        | Join external data             | Case-sensitive

Exam Tips:
----------
📌 Field names = case-sensitive  
📌 Functions and commands = case-insensitive  
📌 Understand OVER vs BY  
📌 SPL logic: Search → Filter → Eval → Transform → Format
